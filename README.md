# Dotfiles repository

This is the central repository to keep all my configuration files for most of the command line tools I'm using. This repository is to be used with the python dotfiles package (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dotfiles/).

## Install

Run

```
./setup
```

in the root of the repository.
